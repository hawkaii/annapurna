## üöÄ How I Deployed This Project on Railway

Deploying this WhatsApp MCP project to the cloud was a breeze, thanks to Railway‚Äôs one-click deployment and my custom template. Here‚Äôs exactly how I did it, so you can follow the same steps!

### Why Railway?

I chose [Railway](https://railway.app/) because it lets me deploy, manage, and scale my Python backend and PostgreSQL database with zero DevOps hassle. It‚Äôs perfect for keeping my WhatsApp AI bot online 24/7, and the dashboard makes everything super easy to monitor and update.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Deployment Steps

#### 1. Created a Railway Template

I built a custom Railway template for this project, which you can use too:
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/whatsapp-mcp)

Just click the button above, or visit [https://railway.com/deploy/whatsapp-mcp](https://railway.com/deploy/whatsapp-mcp), and Railway will guide you through the setup.

#### 2. Connected My GitHub Repo

Railway asked me to link my GitHub account and select this project‚Äôs repository. It automatically detected the Python backend and set up the build environment for me.

#### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Following my own `railway.md` and `.env.example`, I added all the required secrets and API keys in the Railway dashboard:

```env
AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token
VISION_KEY=your_azure_vision_key
VISION_ENDPOINT=your_azure_vision_endpoint
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://username:password@host:port/dbname
```

> **Tip:** You‚Äôll get the `DATABASE_URL` after adding the PostgreSQL plugin in the next step.

#### 4. Added a PostgreSQL Database

Railway makes it super simple to add a database:
- I clicked ‚ÄúAdd Plugin‚Äù and chose **PostgreSQL**.
- Railway generated a secure `DATABASE_URL` for me, which I copied into my environment variables.

#### 5. Deployed with One Click

With everything set, I hit **Deploy** in the dashboard. The logs showed `üöÄ Starting MCP server...`‚Äîand just like that, my backend was live!

#### 6. Connected to WhatsApp via Puch AI

I made sure my [Puch AI](https://puch.ai/) account was set up and linked to my WhatsApp number. Then, I used the public Railway URL as my webhook/backend endpoint in Puch AI.

#### 7. Monitored and Scaled

Railway‚Äôs dashboard let me watch logs, check metrics, and scale the app as needed. If I ever need to redeploy or roll back, it‚Äôs just a click away.
